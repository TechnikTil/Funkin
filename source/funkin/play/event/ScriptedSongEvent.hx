 * A script that can be tied to a SongEvent.

 *
 * - Override `handleEvent(data:SongEventData)` to perform your actions when the event is hit.
 * - Override `getTitle()` to return an event name that will be displayed in the editor.
 * - Override `getEventSchema()` to return a schema for the event data, used to build a form in the chart editor.
